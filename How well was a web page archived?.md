**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [How well was a web page archived?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oHNwPNYmHV5q3puBfv6IQFs-4gTe9XLN2iz2Lgse-1k/edit?tab=t.0)
- Mentors: Mark Graham (Director), Dr. Sawood Alam (Research Lead) & Will Howes (Engineer)
- Problem Background: The Wayback Machine archives billions of web pages but currently doesn't have a way to tell users how complete or accurate these archives are and when there are multiple versions of a page it is hard to know which one is the best representation of the original! Sometimes pages are archived with missing elements or parts of the page might be captured at different times which leads to inconsistencies
- Goal: Develop a quality assurance system that analyzes archived web pages and determines how well they were archived by looking at completeness and other quality factors

**About me**
=====================
I'm a sophomore student studying Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Arya College of Engineering (Rajasthan Technical University). I started my development journey through scratch and later shifted to front end development over the year!

Since then I have learned more of these new technologies like React, MongoDB, Next.js, Express, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript and have worked on various projects like examinationportal.com and triskaideka.xyz

What really interests me about the internet archive's mission is that I have always been a huge fan of it and sometimes there are websites which really inspires me but in the fear of them shutting down I search for it on archive.org and save it for later use. So, I believe wayback machine is a fascinating tool which I absolutely want to be a part of


STILL WORKING!!!
