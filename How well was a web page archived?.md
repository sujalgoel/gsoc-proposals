**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [How well was a web page archived?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oHNwPNYmHV5q3puBfv6IQFs-4gTe9XLN2iz2Lgse-1k/edit?tab=t.0)
- Mentors: Mark Graham (Director), Dr. Sawood Alam (Research Lead) & Will Howes (Engineer)
- Problem Background: The Wayback Machine archives billions of web pages but currently doesn't have a way to tell users how complete or accurate these archives are and when there are multiple versions of a page it is hard to know which one is the best representation of the original! Sometimes pages are archived with missing elements or parts of the page might be captured at different times which leads to inconsistencies
- Goal: Develop a quality assurance system that analyzes archived web pages and determines how well they were archived by looking at completeness and other quality factors

**About Me**
=====================
I'm a sophomore student studying Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Arya College of Engineering (Rajasthan Technical University). I started my development journey through scratch and later shifted to front end development over the year!

Since then I have learned more of these new technologies like React, MongoDB, Next.js, Express, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript and have worked on various projects like examinationportal.com and triskaideka.xyz

What really interests me about the internet archive's mission is that I have always been a huge fan of it and sometimes there are websites which really inspires me but in the fear of them shutting down I search for it on archive.org and save it for later use. So, I believe wayback machine is a fascinating tool which I absolutely want to be a part of

**My Approach**
=====================

I plan to build a system that:

1) Checks for missing page elements

  - Find all the resources a page needs (images, CSS, JS)
  - Check if these resources exist in the archive
  - Calculate what percentage is missing

2) Detects error pages

  - Identify when an archive is actually an error page (404, 500, etc)
  - Recognize custom error pages too

3) Verifies content types

  - Make sure the archived content is the right type (HTML vs PDF)
  - Flag content type mismatches

4) Finds representative versions

  - For pages with many archives, try to identify which ones best represent the page
  - Group similar versions together
  - Highlight significant changes

**Timeline**
=====================

Before June 2

  - Complete preparation work and preliminary research
  - Set up development environment with all necessary tools
  - Study the Wayback Machine's architecture and APIs

Phase 1: Initial Development (June 2 - July 14)

  - Week 1-2: Build basic page analysis framework
    - Develop page requisite extraction system
    - Implement initial metrics for completeness

  - Week 3-4: Core feature implementation
    - Implement error page detection
    - Create content type verification

  - Week 5-6: Integration and midterm preparation
    - Connect components into unified analysis pipeline
    - Prepare midterm demonstration
   
Phase 2: Advanced Features and Refinement (July 19 - August 25)

  - Week 7-8: Representative sample identification
    - Create algorithms to identify best representatives
    - Develop importance weighting for page elements

  - Week 9-11: Testing and optimization
    - Comprehensive testing with diverse web pages
    - Performance optimization
    - Bug fixes and refinements

**Why Me?**
=====================

- I've been using Python for 3 years and am comfortable with web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup
- I've built several websites and understand HTML, CSS and JS well enough to analyze webpage structures
- I'm genuinely interested in digital preservation and the Internet Archive's mission

P.S.: I'm a quick learner and I can also work well independently! I'm excited about the opportunity to help make the Wayback Machine more useful through this project...
